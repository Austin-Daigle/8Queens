# Heuristic Searches: 8Queens

This is an example of a heuristic search algorithm for searching for all of the possible solutions to 8Queens (nQueens formally). This programs has many different
forms of heuristic searches: genetic, backtrack, etc.

## Demonstration Video

## How to use:
Download the [source code](https://github.com/Austin-Daigle/8Queens/blob/main/nQueenAlgorithms.java), then compile and execute the java program.
The program will autocompile the correct solution and with a genetic algorithm as well.

Note: the compiled output is too large to dump onto this repo page so instead a video with the full execution has been included above.
